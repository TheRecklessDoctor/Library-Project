# Library-Project


### Purpose. 

This was one of the first projects in the Javascript section of TheOdinProject and is used to demonstrate understanding of the prior material. I will be following with the curriculum and doing the other projects and pushing them here, to Github. 


### Challenges/New concepts learnt. 

I had to research and learn new concepts and ideas in order to solve the problems that this project saw:

- event delegation
- stopping the default behaviour of the form submit button in HTML
